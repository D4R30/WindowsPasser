# WindowsPasser
A project to unlock windows systems with physical access. The project consists of the tool itself and an ISO file which is simply used for running the tool on the target machine.


# How does it work ?
Remember how you recovered your lost windows login password ? Well, thats somehow the way the program works. The tool replaces itself with the program `sethc.exe`, which is responsible when you for example press shitf 5 times. So after you run the program, just by pressing 5 shifts in login page, a black screen would appear and then you just have to enter username and password!

The ISO file is a customized "Tiny Core Linux" system. The ISO is sth around 17M and it just contains a simple system with basic binaries and WindowsPasser
